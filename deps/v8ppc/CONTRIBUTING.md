This CLA, and the license(s) associated with the Project, provides a license to Your Contributions to the Project and downstream consumers, but You still own Your Contributions, and except for the licenses provided for in this CLA, You reserve all right, title and interest in Your Contributions. 

The Project requires that each Contribution You Submit now or in the future to comply with the following six commitments.

* You will only Submit Contributions where You have authored 100% of the content. 

* You will only Submit Contributions to which You have the necessary rights. This means that if You are employed You have received the necessary permissions from Your employer to make the Contributions. 

* Whatever content You Contribute will be provided under the BSD 3-clause license. You can read a copy of the BSD 3-Clause License at http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause  In the license ```< YEAR> ```, ```< OWNER >``` are assumed to be replaced by Your name and date You supply when signing this Agreement. This is similar to the license associated with the Project. You can see the existing license(s), or find links to the license(s) in the notices and file headers for the Project. 

* You understand and agree that the Project and Your contributions are public, and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information You submit with it, including Your sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with the license(s) involved. 

* You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution is entirely that of the Project and this agreement does not guarantee that the Contribution will be included in the Project. 

* You are not expected to provide support for Your Contribution. However you may provide support for free, for a fee or not at all. You provide Your Contribution on an "AS IS" BASIS as stated in the License. 

You will promptly notify the Project if You become aware of any facts or circumstances that would make these commitments inaccurate in any way. To do so, please send an email to jimmail@uk.ibm.com

If You think the Project could make use of content which You did not author, please talk to a committer on the Project. If they like Your idea, they will know the process to get it included. 

The Project takes intellectual property very seriously, so we are going to ask You to re-confirm this CLA every three years.
